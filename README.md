# Escaping-the-Caves

This project focused on decrypting classical and modern encryption systems, including substitution, Vigen√®re, DES, and AES. By applying frequency analysis, Index of Coincidence, Kasiski test, and differential cryptanalysis, the ciphers were successfully broken. The approach revealed critical vulnerabilities in both traditional ciphers and reduced-round modern encryption, underscoring the importance of robust cryptographic security measures.
